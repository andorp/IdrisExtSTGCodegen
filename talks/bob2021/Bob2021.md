# Architecture of compilers

# ExtSTG and STG interpreter

# Architecture of the Idris2 Compiler

* Surface language =? Dependent types
* Elaboration =? Type Inference
* Code generation
* Backends

# A bit on the backend part

* Lifted
* ANF
* VM

# Compiler Backend API

# Idris2 isn't an optimiser compiler, but

* Optimisation opportunities
* Your backend is responsible for optimisations

# Core Monad

* What's in the core monad?
* How it represents definitions
* Names and Resolved names
* Compiled vs Expr
* How it represents datatypes

# Challenges

* How to represent Values
* How to represent FFI
* Implement String operations
* Implement arbitrary precesion integers
* How to compile TopLevel definitions
* How to get the right arity

# FFI

# Other backends

* Scheme
* RefC
* Lua
